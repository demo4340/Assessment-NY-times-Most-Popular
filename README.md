# Assessment-NY-times-Most-Popular

This project is done in Expo - snack. I have created a Homescreen where we can see a list of articles,
that shows details when items on the list are tapped.

The list of most veiwed articles are fetched from an API that is created from NY Times website using axios.
In order to render the list of articles, map function is being used.
On tapping on any of the articles in the list, it will show more details about the article. This has been done using Linking.openURL.
